Here is my e-commerce mini project. The app component contains components for product form,
product list, customer form, customer list, and order form. All components use state to autmatically
update, delete, or add customers or products without refreshing. Modals are used to demonstrate successful 
transactions, and customers with associated orders are protected from deletion.
